# üè° Real Estate Price Prediction Website

This project walks through a step-by-step process to build a **real estate price prediction website** using **machine learning** and **web technologies**. 

## üöÄ Project Overview
This project is divided into **three main components**:

1. **Machine Learning Model (Data Science & Model Building)**  
   - Train a **Linear Regression** model using **Bangalore home prices dataset** from Kaggle.  
   - Perform **data cleaning, feature engineering, and outlier detection/removal**.  
   - Use **GridSearchCV** for hyperparameter tuning and **K-Fold Cross Validation** for model evaluation.  
   - Save the trained model for future predictions.

2. **Backend API (Python Flask Server)**  
   - Develop a **Flask API** to serve HTTP requests.  
   - Load the trained model and return price predictions based on user input.

3. **Frontend Website (User Interface)**  
   - Build a **web UI using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
   - Allow users to input property details (square footage, number of bedrooms, location, etc.).  
   - Send requests to the Flask server and display the predicted price.
